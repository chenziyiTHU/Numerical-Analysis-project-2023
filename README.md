# Numerical-Analysis-project-2023

This is the final project of Numerical Analysis 2023 in Qiuzhen college, finished and submitted by 陈子逸 2021011633. To give you a better understanding of the code and the report, please following this text.

## Programming Problem 1

Please refer to the file 'Direct solver'.

The main code of this problem is 'DirectSolver.m', which is based on the example given by the paper of Lee and Greengard. 

If you want to change the settings, including the ordinary differential equation, boundary conditions, order of the method, etc., you can directly alter the values of constants in 'Initialization' and the rest functions.

## Programming Problem 2

Please refer to the file 'Linear solver'.

The main code of this problem is 'LinearSolver.m', which is also based on the example given by the paper of Lee and Greengard. 

If you want to change the settings, including the ordinary differential equation, boundary conditions, order of the method, etc., you can directly alter the values of constants in 'Initialization' and the rest functions.

## Programming Problem 3

Please refer to the file 'Nonlinear solver'.

The main code of this problem is 'NonlinearSolver.m', which is based on a nonlinear differential equation with solution to be the Lambert W function.

If you want to change the settings, including the ordinary differential equation, boundary conditions, order of the method, etc., you can directly alter the values of constants in 'Initialization' and the rest functions.

## Report
